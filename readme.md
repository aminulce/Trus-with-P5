# Application of P5.js to draw frames

**P5.js is a versatite javascript library library for drawing elements on an HTML canvas. I tried to use it in drawing members and supports
with a view to providing a user interface for the user. The ultimate goal is to collect node and element data from this window and use another javasvript finite element
library (FEM-LST) to solbe and generate stress-strain and other essesntial outputs. The ultimate goal of these packages is to develop some sort of VALIDATED finite element
library which is intuitve to use and provide some basic yet powerful results to the user. These libraries by-no-way try to supplant a full fledged finite element softwares.**
